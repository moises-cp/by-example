## Description

This is a basic demonstration of how to setup a form in React using
only pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this example, there are not
third party libraries for the user interface, or data validation. We
are using plain HTML input fields with their built-in validation,
JavaScript to handle the form submission and displaying any error, and
plain CSS to make it look a little bit better.

After the form has been submitted without any errors, the submitted
data will be displayed below the 'Submit' button.

Even though this is a basic demo, the form has been set up to be
dynamic within a certain category of input fields. This means that we
can add or remove HTML input fields without needing to update the
JavaScript.

There are different approaches and libraries to achieve this. The goal
here was to illustrate one simple way to accomplish it using only
plain (vanilla) JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you are a developer and
would like to share your thoughts, please let me know.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
